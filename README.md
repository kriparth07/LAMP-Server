# LAMP-Server
In this project i created the LAMP server in VirtualBox. LAMP is an acronym for the operating system, Linux; the web server, Apache; the database server, MySQL; and the programming language, PHP. All four of these technologies are open source, which means they are community maintained and freely available for anyone to use. I use LAMP stacks to create, host, and maintain web content. It is a popular solution that powers many of the websites you commonly use today. I did this Project as part of my school project.
